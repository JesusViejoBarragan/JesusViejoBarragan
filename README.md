  👨‍💻 Aspiring Software Developer

Hi! I’m Jesús Viejo Barragán, a passionate software development student with a strong drive for continuous learning and improvement. I have completed a Higher Technical Degree in Multiplatform Application Development at CEU San Pablo University and am now actively seeking my first professional opportunity in the tech world.

On my GitHub profile, I share projects and exercises where I apply my skills in:

Languages: Java, PHP, JavaScript.

Frameworks and libraries: Swing, Spring, Hibernate, JavaFX.

Tools: Docker, GitHub, API Rest.

I also hold certifications in Scrum Foundation and Docker for Developers, which allow me to work efficiently in agile environments and with modern technologies.

I consider myself a problem-solver, a team player, and someone who can quickly adapt to new technologies. Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
